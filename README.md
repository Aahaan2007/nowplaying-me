## üîß Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- A Spotify account
- A registered Spotify Developer application

### Local Development
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nowplaying-me.git
   cd nowplaying-me
   ```

2. Update the Spotify API credentials in `js/spotify-auth.js` with your own credentials from the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

3. Serve the application locally using a simple HTTP server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## üìù How It Works

1. The app authenticates with Spotify using the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow
2. After successful authentication, the app fetches data from various Spotify Web API endpoints
3. The retrieved data is presented in an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard

## üîê Privacy and Security

- The app only requests the necessary Spotify permissions (scopes)
- Authentication is handled securely using industry-standard protocols
- No user data is stored on our servers - everything is processed client-side
